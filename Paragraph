In this project I used a version control system to download a file onto a repository made online, update a file in a repository, upload 
a file into a repository online, as well as commit when I do something with the repository. After developing the code I hadn't built the 
repository yet so I needed to do that quickly. I signed into github and used their GUI to easily made a repository. I uploaded my python 
file and realized that this first lesson waw on using code to edit repositories. After cloning my repositoy for use, I made a small change 
and pushed my change through to show I know how to do that. I then created this file and pushed that as well.
